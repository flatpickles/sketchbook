# Sketchbook Overview

Sketchbook is a forkable development environment for HTML canvas artwork & prototypes. Sketchbook is also a customizable webapp for publishing these projects. After [creating a fork](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/fork), you can use Sketchbook to streamline your creative coding work, and then easily deploy a webapp to showcase your projects.

Read on for a conceptual overview, or jump right into the [quick start guide](quick-start.md)!

### Sketchbook's Goals

If you're considering using Sketchbook, you probably already have a creative coding workflow that works well for you. Sketchbook intends to respect your existing skills, preferences, and prior work. Whether you're building native graphics for the HTML canvas, using a framework like P5, or pursuing any other sort of web-based code artistry, Sketchbook intends to help you achieve a few common goals in a streamlined way.

The first of these goals is **parameterization**. While building art projects and prototypes, we often want to isolate adjustable values that change the appearance or behavior of our work, and thus parameterization is a core concept in Sketchbook. By simply defining instance variables within Sketchbook project classes, you can expose these values in a parameters panel, making them easy to update live as the project is running. Sketchbook supports a wide variety of parameter types and input styles, discussed further on the [Parameter Configuration](param-config.md) page.

Sketchbook also seeks to make **publishing** work as easy as possible. Sharing creative code projects is often a cumbersome process, especially when seeking to publish projects in a fully interactive form. Using Sketchbook gives you continuity between your development setup and what you present to the world: you'll use the Sketchbook webapp to organize and run your projects locally as you're building them, and then you'll deploy the very same app for others to use, including the projects you've built within it. Step-by-step instructions for publishing are included on the [Deploying Sketchbook](deploying.md) page.

The final high-level intentions worth mentioning here are **simplicity** and **configurability**, which hopefully coexist in Sketchbook's design. It will only take you a few minutes to learn how to build projects within Sketchbook, and it should be easy to incorporate your existing tools and techniques. Nonetheless, Sketchbook is built to be as customizable and extensible as possible, though you shouldn't encounter this additional complexity until you need it. The [settings](settings.md), [content](content.md), and [theme](theme.md) pages are here when you're ready for them.

### Diving In

If you're ready to try out Sketchbook, continue on to the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) page and follow the instructions to get set up! You can also continue learning about how projects and parameters are modeled within Sketchbook on the [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) page, and explore the other documentation pages linked from the sidebar on the left.

Though every attempt has been made to deliver a stable and polished platform for your creative work, Sketchbook is under active development. If you encounter any bugs, have trouble incorporating tools and techniques you wish to use, or find this documentation lacking in any way, please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/issues/new)! PRs are also welcome for any improvements or added functionality, and you can find more notes on contributing to Sketchbook's development [here](contributing.md).
