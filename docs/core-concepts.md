# Core Concepts

So far, you've learned about Sketchbook's intentions on the [Overview](README.md) page, and experimented with a basic project implementation on the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) page. Read on to learn more about Sketchbook's fundamentals.

### `src/art` File Structure

### The `Project` Class

### Project Parameters

### Presets

Presets are [on the roadmap](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/issues/21) for Sketchbook 1.0, and will eventually be documented here, if not in their own page. Stay tuned!
