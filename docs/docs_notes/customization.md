Sketchbook -> Docs -> Customization

# Customizing Sketchbook

Sketchbook is designed to be adapted to your needs and aesthetics. With some knowledge of the configuration options available, you can extensively customize the look, feel, and behavior of Sketchbook without modifying the underlying SvelteKit code.

## content.ts

todo: discuss text (and the like) that is presented in the app, and can be customized here. Talk about what can be omitted.

## theme.scss

todo: discuss visual appearance

## config.ts

todo: discuss behavior defaults

Note file change vs localStorage behavior - check if value in backing file has changed... etc
