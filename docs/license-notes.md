# License Notes

Sketchbook uses the MIT License, as indicated in the [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) file. This requires a preservation of the original copyright and license notice in any derivative works, but enables permissive use and adaptation of the license terms for any modifications or additions.

In the Sketchbook context, this means that any work in your `src/art` directory will by default inherit the original license and copyright, but you are encouraged to either add your name to the `LICENSE.txt` file in the project root, and/or establish your own copyright within the `src/art` directory. The latter could be either be solely attributed to your name while maintaining the MIT License, or you can specify "all rights reserved" to indicate that no OSS license applies to the projects you build within Sketchbook. You could include this in an `src/art/COPYRIGHT.txt` file, with text that reads something like:

```
Copyright (c) [Year] [Your Name]
All rights reserved.

The contents of this subdirectory is subject to a different copyright notice than the remainder of the project, and is the exclusive property of [Your Name]. You may not distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise make this work or any derivative works available to the public without the explicit written permission of [Your Name].

For licensing inquiries or permissions, please contact [Your Contact Information].

```

Note that the MIT License also permits closed-source use, so the above may only apply if your code is publicly available, e.g. a public Sketchbook fork on your GitHub account.
