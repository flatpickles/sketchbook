# Project Subtypes

Though anything you can do with Sketchbook can be accomplished by subclassing the `Project` class, Sketchbook also offers easier workflows for a few more specific types of projects.

## `P5Project`

`P5Project` is a relatively lightweight `Project` subclass that makes it easy to use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) within Sketchbook. When you create a Sketchbook project that subclasses `P5Project`, p5.js will be spun up in ["instance mode"](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/p5), and you'll be able to use this p5 instance for rendering.

The `P5Project` class defines a few methods that match the standard functions used in a p5.js context, so you can build p5 projects in a familiar way. When using p5.js in instance mode, all library functions must be called on a p5 instance; `P5Project` offers a `p5` instance variable, and the same reference is also passed as a parameter to p5-related methods.

A basic `P5Project` subclass implementation might look like this:

```ts
import P5Project from '$lib/base/Project/P5Project';
import type P5 from 'p5';

export default class P5Demo extends P5Project {
    rectSize = 0.5; // "rectSize" is adjustable in the Sketchbook UI

    draw(p5: P5) {
        p5.background(100);
        p5.rect(0, 0, this.rectSize * p5.width, this.rectSize * p5.height);
    }
}
```

You can find the `P5Project` superclass [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/blob/main/src/lib/base/Project/P5Project.ts), or in your code editor. You can also check out the "P5 Demo" project [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/tree/demo/src/art/P5Demo), and on the Sketchbook [demo deployment](https://demo.skbk.cc/P5Demo).

## Shader Art

Sketchbook offers direct support for fragment shader art, without requiring any GL boilerplate or setup code. You can create a `.frag` file within a `src/art` subdirectory of the same name, and Sketchbook will draw this fragment shader onto a rectangle upon each animation frame, using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) under the hood. You do not need to create a `Project` subclass directly â€“ Sketchbook creates one for you internally.

A basic fragment shader in Sketchbook might be implemented in `src/art/DemoShader/DemoShader.frag`, and could look like this:

```glsl
precision mediump float;
varying vec2 vUv;
uniform float time;
uniform float green; // "Greenness", 0.5

void main() {
    vec3 bgColor = vec3(vUv.x, green, sin(time) / 2.0 + 0.5);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(bgColor, 1.0);
}
```

You can also check out the "Shader Art" demo project [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/tree/demo/src/art/ShaderArt), and on the Sketchbook [demo deployment](https://demo.skbk.cc/ShaderArt).

### Shader Uniforms and Parameters

Sketchbook will define normalized (0.0-1.0) rendering coordinates for you to use in your fragment shader as `varying vec2 vUv`. Sketchbook also defines a few utility uniforms that you can use:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Uniform | Type | Units | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `time` | `float` | Seconds | Runtime since project instantiation. |
| `renderSize` | `vec2` | Pixels | Viewport size. |
| `scaledTime` | `float` | Seconds (scaled) | Continuous time value with an adjustable rate of increase. When a `scaledTime` uniform is present, a `timeScale` parameter will automatically become available in the Sketchbook UI, and will be used to scale the rate of increase for the `scaledTime` uniform value. You can create multiple `scaledTime` uniforms with numeric suffixes, and they will each have separate corresponding `timeScale` parameters, e.g. `scaledTime3` & `timeScale3`.

You can create additional uniforms within your `.frag` file, which Sketchbook will recognize and display as adjustable parameters. Reasonable defaults are assigned, and your uniform values can be updated via parameter inputs in the Sketchbook UI. `float`, `int`, `bool`, `vec2`, `vec3`, and `vec4` uniform parameters are supported.

### Multipass Rendering

Sketchbook's shader art support now allows rendering in multiple passes, with intermediate passes rendered to associated framebuffers. All off-screen framebuffers have the same dimensions as the final output pass, i.e. Sketchbook's canvas size.

Multipass rendering is useful for many things, generally for techniques that require multiple processing passes for each frame (e.g. gaussian blur), or techniques that leverage previously rendered state (e.g. motion blur). As you might expect, an intermediate pass cannot access the framebuffer that it renders to, but other framebuffers are accessible, including those most recently rendered from previous frames.

Fragment shader projects will automatically render in multiple passes when you include `sampler2D passBuffer` uniforms with numeric suffixes. When providing these uniforms, non-final passes will automatically be compiled with associated `PASS` definitions, e.g. `#define PASS_0` for a first pass that renders to `passBuffer0`. You can then evaluate these `PASS` definitions within your shader code for conditional rendering in each pass.

Here's a simple multipass example, which applies a motion blur to an orbiting circle.

```
precision mediump float;

varying vec2 vUv;
uniform float time;
uniform vec2 renderSize;

uniform sampler2D passBuffer0;
uniform sampler2D passBuffer1;

void main() {

#if defined PASS_0 // (output to passBuffer0)
    // scale uv to aspect ratio:
    vec2 xy = vUv * 2.0 - 1.0;
    xy.y = xy.y * renderSize.y / renderSize.x;
    // draw a circle orbiting the center:
    vec2 center = vec2(sin(time) / 2.0, cos(time) / 2.0);
    float dist = distance(xy, center);
    vec4 current = vec4(vec3(step(dist, 0.1)), 1.0);
    // mix with the previous frame:
    vec4 previous = texture(passBuffer1, vUv);
    gl_FragColor = mix(current, previous, 0.9);

#elif defined PASS_1 // (output to passBuffer1)
    // preserve the first pass for use in the next frame:
    gl_FragColor = texture(passBuffer0, vUv);

#else // (output to screen)
    // render the first pass directly to the screen:
    gl_FragColor = texture(passBuffer0, vUv);

#endif
}
```

### Configuration and Other Features

You can configure your fragment shader projects as you would configure other Sketchbook projects, with a `config.json` file in your project directory. Uniform names are used as keys for parameter configuration in the config file, or you can use inline annotations as described in the [param config](param-config.md) documentation. Default values can also be defined alongside your shader parameters; `0.5` will be used as the default value for "Greenness", in the example [above](project-subtypes.md?id=shader-art).

Thanks to [vite-plugin-glsl](https://github.com/UstymUkhman/vite-plugin-glsl), you can use the `#include` keyword in your shader files to import the contents of other files, enabling you to build modular shader projects. Using `#include` statements, you can work with bundled dependencies from [Lygia](https://lygia.xyz/) and other shader libraries. This applies for fragment shader projects as discussed above, and also for any GLSL files that you import in a custom GL project.

Sketchbook also comes with built-in [glslify](https://github.com/glslify/glslify) support: any GLSL shader files you define will be automatically be compiled with glslify, using whichever glslify modules you've added via `npm install`. Similarly to `#include` support, this applies for any shader files you create in your Sketchbook.

To see how Sketchbook's fragment shader project support works under the hood, see the `FragShaderProject` class [on GitHub](https://github.com/flatpickles/sketchbook/blob/main/src/lib/base/Project/FragShaderProject.ts), or in your code editor.
